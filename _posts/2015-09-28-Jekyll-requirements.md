##Installation

Getting Jekyll installed and ready-to-go should only take a few minutes. If it ever becomes a pain in the ass, please file an issue (or submit a pull request) describing the issue you encountered and how we might make the process easier.

##Requirements

Installing Jekyll is easy and straight-forward, but there are a few requirements youâ€™ll need to make sure your system has before you start.

* Ruby (including development headers, v1.9.3 or above for Jekyll 2 and v2 or above for Jekyll 3)
* RubyGems
* Linux, Unix, or Mac OS X
* NodeJS, or another JavaScript runtime (Jekyll 2 and earlier, for CoffeeScript support).
* Python (Jekyll 2 and earlier)
