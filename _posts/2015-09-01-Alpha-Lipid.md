Colostrum is nature’s first food, the pre-milk fluid all female mammals provide for their infants in the first few days after birth. Colostrum provides vital immune and growth factors and essential vitamins and minerals which contribute to an infant’s healthy development and, in particular, to the development of a responsive immune system.

Because colostrum is non-species specific, scientists have found bovine colostrum may support good health in humans long after birth – from infancy to old age.

Naturally rich in highly concentrated compounds including immune components, antioxidants and factors to support healing, bovine colostrum helps to:

Support the health of our digestive tract
Nourish the gut wall
Promote overall digestive health
A healthy gut wall provides a natural defence system for the body, for good immunity and resistance to bugs, ills and chills.

Bovine colostrum has a long history of use among cultures throughout the world. In India, for example, locals have considered colostrum a traditional remedy for thousands of years. Modern science continues to make fascinating discoveries about colostrum as a health tonic.

It’s the Alpha Lipid™ difference that makes Lifeline™ unique

Colostrum is becoming well known for its health benefits, but not all colostrum products are created equal.

To obtain the maximum benefits of colostrum it is important that as much natural bioactive colostrum is delivered to the body as possible.

Coating colostrum particles with the exclusive Alpha Lipid™ extract ensures they are protected as they pass through the harsh stomach environment.

The Alpha Lipid™ coating is both water and fat soluble, improving dispersion and absorption of the colostrum particles into the body.

A large number of scientific studies now support the health benefits of colostrum, and **New Image International has the only patent-protected colostrum product in the world.**
